🤔 What Is Tokenomics?

Tokenomics = Token + Economics

It defines:

- How tokens are created
- How they are distributed
- How value is maintained over time

---

🧱 Key Components of Tokenomics

🔢 Total Supply

The maximum number of tokens that will ever exist.

- Fixed supply → Scarcity
- Unlimited supply → Inflation risk

---

📉 Circulating Supply

Tokens currently available in the market.

Low circulating supply can cause high volatility.

---

📈 Inflation vs Deflation

- Inflationary: More tokens are created over time
- Deflationary: Tokens are burned or removed

---

🔥 Token Burning

Permanent removal of tokens to reduce supply.

Purpose:

- Increase scarcity
- Control inflation

---

⏳ Vesting & Unlocks

Tokens are released gradually to:

- Prevent dumping
- Align long-term incentives

Common for:

- Team
- Advisors
- Early investors

---

🎯 Utility

What the token is actually used for:

- Fees
- Governance
- Access
- Rewards

No utility = weak token.

---

🗳 Governance

Token holders can:

- Vote on proposals
- Shape the project’s future

---

💧 Liquidity

How easily tokens can be bought or sold.

Low liquidity = high risk.

---

🚩 Common Tokenomics Red Flags

- Huge supply controlled by few wallets
- No clear utility
- Fast unlock schedules
- Unsustainable rewards

---

🧠 How to Analyze Tokenomics (Simple Checklist)

- What is the total supply?
- Who owns the tokens?
- When do tokens unlock?
- What is the token used for?
- Is inflation controlled?

---

🧪 Real-World Examples

- Bitcoin → Fixed supply
- Ethereum → Utility + burning
- Governance tokens → Voting power
